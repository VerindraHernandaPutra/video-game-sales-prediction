# video-game-sales-prediction

This project is my first machine learning big data project, which I worked on as part of a study group hosted by MBC (Machine Learning and Big Data Community). The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that forecasts video game sales based on historical data.

# Overview
In this project, I analyze a dataset containing information about video games such as their sales, release dates, platforms, genres, and other features. Using machine learning techniques, I aim to predict the sales of video games based on these features.

# Features
 - Data Preprocessing: Clean the data and handle missing values.
 - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize trends and relationships in the dataset.
 - Modeling: Apply regression techniques to build a predictive model.
 - Evaluation: Measure the model's performance using relevant metrics.

# Getting Started
To run this project:

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/VerindraHernandaPutra/video-game-sales-prediction.git

2. Install the required libraries:
   You can install the necessary dependencies by running:

   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Open the Jupyter notebook:
   Navigate to the video-game-sales-prediction.ipynb file and open it in Jupyter or any compatible environment.
