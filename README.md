# VIDEO GAME SALES PREDICTION WITH REGRESSION

This project is my first machine learning big data project, which I worked on as part of a study group hosted by MBC (Machine Learning and Big Data Community). The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that forecasts video game sales based on historical data.

## Dataset
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gregorut/videogamesales

## Overview
In this project, I analyze a dataset containing information about video games such as their sales, release dates, platforms, genres, and other features. Using machine learning techniques, I aim to predict the sales of video games based on these features.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean the data and handle missing values.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize trends and relationships in the dataset.
- **Modeling**: Apply regression techniques to build a predictive model.
- **Evaluation**: Measure the model's performance using relevant metrics.

## Getting Started

To run this project:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/VerindraHernandaPutra/video-game-sales-prediction.git
